                                <p>The growth of virtual items and microtransactions have been enormous over the last few years. The prices for these items or microtransactions are often twice the price of the game itself. We understand people want these
                                    exclusive in-game rewards, but we also see how they are too expensive for many. Therefore we came up with the idea, {{vars.site}}.

                                <p>We started providing a service directly targeted towards the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, however, we quickly came to realize this had the potential to reach a much broader audience. Now we have expanded our service
                                    for not only gamers, but also others that want gift cards to shop at their favorite place, cryptocurrencies to start their crypto adventure, or just direct PayPal cash to spend on whatever you want.</p>
                                <p>Weâ€™re excited for what the future has to bring, and we will continuously be pushing out updates and new features to keep {{vars.site}} the leading platform in the GPT industry
